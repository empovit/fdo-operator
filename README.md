# fdo-operator
The FDO Operator deploys [FIDO Device Onboard (FDO)](https://fidoalliance.org/intro-to-fido-device-onboard/) servers on Red Hat OpenShift.

## Description
The FDO Operator makes it easier to deploy and run any of the FDO servers (manufacturing, rendezvous, or owner-onboarding) on Red Hat OpenShift, catering to both device manufacturers and device owners.


https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/

Before some of the custom resources created by the operator can start, they  require the following pre-configured Kubernetes resources:

* Keys and certificates
* Persistent volume claims (PVCs)



The development is a work in progress and

// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use
* Link to the FDO implementation
* Routes
* Owner+onboarding and service-info API as a single unit (pod)

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need an OpenShift cluster to run against. You can use [Red Hat OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

// TODO:
* Generating keys
* How to create service info files
* Onboarding a VM, enabling traffic between a "device" and the cluster
* PVCs, a shared PV or copying OVs from manufacturer to owner

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/fdo-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/fdo-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
